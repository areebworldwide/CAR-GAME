# CAR-GAME
**Speed Racer** is a 2D arcade-style car racing game made using **Python (Pygame)**. The player controls a red car that races down a busy road filled with blue enemy cars. Your goal is to avoid collisions, survive as long as possible, and score maximum points.  The game features smooth animations, increasing speed levels, and real-time collision detection. Players can pause the game anytime, view their previous scores in the **Game History**, and compete with themselves by breaking their **High Score**. All game data is saved locally using text and JSON files, so progress is never lost.  It’s a fun, lightweight, and engaging project perfect for learning **Pygame**, game loops, event handling, and basic file management in Python.
